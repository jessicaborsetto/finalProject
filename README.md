# Final Epicode Project
## React Redux Weather and Job Research Apps

### Overview
This repository contains two React applications, a Weather App, and a Job Research App. These apps utilize React, Redux for state management, Bootstrap for responsiveness, and HTTP API fetch to retrieve data.

### Weather App
The Weather App allows users to search for the current weather and forecast of a city. The search bar is dynamically connected to the city searched, displaying relevant weather information. Additionally, if the user searches for something other than a city, the app gracefully handles the error and provides feedback.

### Job Research App
The Job Research App allows user to search for a job, add the position to their favourites and delete it from it. It also has an error 404 page if the url path doesn't exist.
